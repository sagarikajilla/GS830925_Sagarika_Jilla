# GS830925_Sagarika_Jilla
This PWA, built with React, TypeScript, and Redux, manages Stores, SKUs, Planning, and Charts. It features a responsive design, state persistence, an AG Grid with computed fields, and authentication. The project showcases modern front-end skills, including advanced UI integration and state management.
## How to Run and Test

Test the App:

Log in with:

Username: demo  Password: demo123

Use the sidebar to switch between pages (Stores, SKUs, Planning, Charts).
Data changes (add/edit/delete/reorder) persist across refreshes.
Highlights
State Management & Persistence:
Redux and redux-persist ensure that all updates remain even after page refresh, demonstrating robust state handling.

Advanced UI:
The Planning screen features a cross join of Stores and SKUs in AG Grid with dynamically grouped calendar columns, computed fields, and conditional formatting.

Authentication:
A custom authentication flow using React Context protects routes, ensuring secure access with demo credentials.

Future Improvements
Enhanced UI/UX:
Integrate a UI library (e.g., Material-UI) for a more polished look.

Comprehensive Testing:
Add unit/integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

Performance Optimizations:
Optimize AG Grid for larger datasets (virtualization, lazy loading).

Robust Error Handling:
Implement advanced error logging (e.g., Sentry) and user-friendly error messages.

Feedback
The challenge covers a broad range of skills (responsive design, state management, advanced UI, and authentication), which is excellent for evaluating full-stack capabilities.
Additional detailed wireframes and data format clarifications for complex screens (like Planning) would further improve the challenge.
