# GS830925_Sagarika_Jilla
This PWA, built with React, TypeScript, and Redux, manages Stores, SKUs, Planning, and Charts. It features a responsive design, state persistence, an AG Grid with computed fields, and authentication. The project showcases modern front-end skills, including advanced UI integration and state management.
## How to Run and Test

Test the App:

Log in with:

Username: demo  Password: demo123

Use the sidebar to switch between pages (Stores, SKUs, Planning, Charts).
Data changes (add/edit/delete/reorder) persist across refreshes.
Highlights
State Management & Persistence:
Redux and redux-persist ensure that all updates remain even after page refresh, demonstrating robust state handling.

Advanced UI:
The Planning screen features a cross join of Stores and SKUs in AG Grid with dynamically grouped calendar columns, computed fields, and conditional formatting.

Authentication:
A custom authentication flow using React Context protects routes, ensuring secure access with demo credentials.

Future Improvements
Enhanced UI/UX:
Integrate a UI library (e.g., Material-UI) for a more polished look.

Comprehensive Testing:
Add unit/integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

Performance Optimizations:
Optimize AG Grid for larger datasets (virtualization, lazy loading).

Robust Error Handling:
Implement advanced error logging (e.g., Sentry) and user-friendly error messages.

Feedback
The challenge covers a broad range of skills (responsive design, state management, advanced UI, and authentication), which is excellent for evaluating full-stack capabilities.
Additional detailed wireframes and data format clarifications for complex screens (like Planning) would further improve the challenge.



=======
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
